# Finance-Tracker-App
<b>This repository contains my Finance Tracking App:</b><br><br>
This is a project of mine that I am using to help keep track of my finances. I wanted a program that would help me to track how much money I make compared to how much I spend. I also wanted to track which bills were costing me the most money. This is going to help me with finding ways to save money.

<b>To do list:</b><br>
<ol>
  <li>Work on income import issue - income import not working correctly. Income being duplicated rather than added to during import.</li>
  <li>Search functionality in the bills and paychecks breakdown tabs not working correctly.</li>
  <li>Need to setup a place for the export function to place the exported file.</li>
  <li>Need to add different types of exports. (financial reports, bill breakdowns, income vs bills report, ect...)</li>
</ol>
